                            Hi, I'm David, and I am a frontend developer, having a work experience of more than 4 years. 
                            My job is a building websites of different complexity, makeing HTML pages from mockup, 
                            error fixing etc... I am using the Angular2+ framework with appropriate technologies and 
                            implementing its features in the application professionally. I think the hard-working, 
                            and responsibility is the more important qualities, that people should have to work in a 
                            team. I would like to work with friendly and professional people. Thank you for your time 
                            and interest.
